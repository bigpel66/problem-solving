// 210. Course Schedule II

// fundOrder Function finds the order of the course taking.
// Some of courses have some prerequisites.
// If the chaining count is 0, then the course should be append to the result slice.
// Others could be ordered and appended to the slice by using BFS + Topological Sort.
// To use Topological Sort, count slice and map have been used.
// Remember that prerequisites slice is not bidirectional graph. [a_i, b_i] means b_i is the prerequisites of a_i, so b_i -> a_i will be built. Also, the count of specific node which has some prerequisites will be incremented.
// If there's a cycle such as [[1, 0], [1, 2], [0, 1]], then output should be []. Thus, counting the number of course is necessary.
