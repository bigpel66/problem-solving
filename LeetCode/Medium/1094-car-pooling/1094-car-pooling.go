// 1094. Car Pooling
//
// https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/

// carPooling function finds whether the car pooling is possible or not.
// [2, 1, 5] means 2 people get on the station 1, and they are dropped by on the station 5.
// There are only 1000 stations at most, just record how many people are incremented or decremented at each station on the slice.
// Only O(n) is required both time and memory complexity.
