// maxDistToClosest function finds the maximum distance to the closest person from the given seats.
// 0 0 0 1 -> value should be 3 which is the number of 0s on the left side.
// 1 0 0 0 0 -> value should be 4 which is the number of 0s on the right side.
// 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 -> value should be 3 which is the number of zeros in the middle of the each side 1s.
// Thus, check the 0s on the each side. (Temporarilly, one of those will be the maximum distance.)
// Also, check the 0s on the middle area. This procedure only needs the sequential search to count the 0s. The number of 0s divided by 2 should be compared to the previous maximum value and update it.
// On searching the middle area, the skipping 1s and checking 0s have been used.
