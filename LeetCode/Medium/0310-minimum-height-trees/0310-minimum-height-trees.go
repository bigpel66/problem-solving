// 310. Minimum Height Trees
//
// https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/

// findMinHeightTrees Function finds the possible root nodes which has the minimum height.
// Finding the longest path of the tree by DFS can be possible, but topological sort is more suitable.
// To find the minimum height, remove the possible leaf nodes by iterative loop.
// Removing leaf nodes can be done by looking up the edges.
// Also the iterating should be stopped when the existing nodes are less than or equal to 2.
