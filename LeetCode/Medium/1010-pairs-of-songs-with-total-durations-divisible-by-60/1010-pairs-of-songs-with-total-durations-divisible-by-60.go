// numPairsDivisibleBy60 function finds the number of pairs that makes divisible by 60.
// First, check 60 - (one of time t % 60) exists. This element is the count that sum of two elements divisible by 60.
// Above value of the element is 0 by default, so just addition is fine.
// Second, one of time t % 60 should be incremented that a half of a pair is already exists.
// Exceptionally, the number which is divisible by 60 would be index 60 but there's no index 60 on the first process.
// Though index 60 exsists, index 0 will be updated in the second process.
// Thus, specific case should be process when the number is divisible by 60.
// When the number is divisible by 60, count should be updated by the index 0.
