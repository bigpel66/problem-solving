// 1463. Cherry Pickup II
//
// https://leetcode.com/problems/cherry-pickup-ii/
// 	There are two robots which are collecting cherries from the given grid.
// 	A robot is on the (0, 0), and another robot is on the (0, cols - 1).
// 	Robot can move toward the left bottom, toward bottom, right bottom.

// max function finds the maximum value among the inputs.
func max(input ...int) int {
	val := -int(^uint(0)>>1) - 1
	for _, i := range input {
		if val < i {
			val = i
		}
	}
	return val
}

// cherryPickup function calculates the maximum cherries that can be collected.
// Let's define the coordinate of rows is x, the coordinate of cols is y.
// Pretend that the 3 Dimensional Slices DP[a][b][c] is the memoization of robot's move.
// Robot 1's coordinate is (a, b) and Robot 2's coordinate is (a, c).
// Then the DP[a][b][c] is the maximum value of collected cherries on that coordinates.
// All of the value in the DP are -1 when they are initialized.
// The spaces for the y have been created 2 tiles more than orignal because of robots move. Thus, the range of y is 1 to cols. (The range of x are as same as the original, so 0 to rows - 1.)
// The first rows of DP can be calculated with (0, 0) and (0, cols - 1). Thus the iterations for the x starts from 1 to rows - 1.
// Originally, y iterates 0 to cols - 1. However, y will be iterated by 1 to cols because tiles have been added.
// There are two ys for the robot1 and robot2. Thus, DP for the current position is DP[i][y1][y2] and it will be accumulated by previous one.
// Because DP solution is optimal, so the maximum value should be found before accumulated. To do this, there are 9 ways by considering the robots move.
// When it gets the maximum value of previous one, the number of cherry should be appened. But if y1 and y2 are the same position, only a sole value should be accumulated. Or, both value should be.
// The answer can be got on the last rows of DP, thus comparing each element should be done.
