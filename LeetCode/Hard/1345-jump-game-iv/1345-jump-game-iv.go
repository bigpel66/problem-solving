// 1345. Jump Game IV
//
// https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-iv/

// minJumps function finds the number of jumps to reach finish point.
// The player can jump to 1 step backward and forward, the point which number is same.
// Thus, there are 3 cases for each step. This will be solved by the BFS Queueing.
// For each queueing is for a 1 step, and checks whether reaching to the final point is possible or not.
// If it is, return the steps. Or enque the possible 3 cases from the point.
// The queued 3 cases will be processed on the next step naturally (the cases on the same step will be proessed first due to the queue).
// Not to visit the duplicated point, visitd slice has been used.
// Also, for jumping to the same value, position hash map has been used.
// The position map always have to be resovled only once the value entered. Thus, resolved hash map has been used.
