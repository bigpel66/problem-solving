// 1510. Stone Game IV

// https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iv/

// winnerSquareGame function returns true if Alice wins, false if Bob wins.
// About turn to play the game, Alice always starts first.
// Once Alice wins, it should be makred false to true.
// For example to make number 7, Alice can choose number 1 or 4.
// Then, the result depends on dp[7 - 1] or dp[7 - 4].
// If dp[7 - 1] was false (Alice loses), then dp[7] can be marked as true.
// Also if dp[7 - 4] was false (Alice loses), then dp[7] can be marked as true.
// To get dp[7], dp[7 - 1] and dp[7 - 4] can be done as same way. Thus, every number until input n should be calculated.
// Iteratings on outer loop for 1 to n, and inner loop for square numbers until outer one should be done.
