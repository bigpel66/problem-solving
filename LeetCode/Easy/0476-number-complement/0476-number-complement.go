// https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/

// findComplement function finds the complement number from input number.
// Binary of 5 is 101, and complement of 101 is 010 which is 2.
// To find the complement number, must consider the type size.
// 5 in 64-bit is 0000....101, and its complement is 1111....010 which is not 2.
// The complement number 1111....010 should be masked by 0000...111.
