// 1200. Minimum Absolute Difference

// To get the minimum difference, sorting is necessary.
// Package sort supports the O(nlogn) sorting algorithm.

// minimumAbsDifference Function finds some pairs of two integer elements which makes the  minimum difference of the given array.
// The function name implies the absolute value, but only the minimum difference is the hint.
// If the array is maintained with the ascending orders, the minimum difference can be found by a loop which calculates the value of the i + 1 th element - the value of the i th element.
// When a new difference is smaller than the previous one, make a new slices which holds the the vallue of the i th element, the value of the i + 1 element.
// If a difference is as same as the previous one, just append the pair into the original slices.
// Repeat to the end of the given array.
